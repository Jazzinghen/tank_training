# Tank Training Project
This is a simple game project to work on game design and development. While it could be fun for others to play it is
not really intended to be released as a game. I am aiming to complete this and then move to another prototype.

Even though I feel a little ashamed this project is inspired by the Udemy course "Unreal Engine C++ Developer". I am
ashamed more because I needed to get a course to get the ball rolling than because it's on Udemy.

## Game Design Document (GDD)
I am not sure the GDD is needed for such a project but I feel it is a good practice to design it and have it around to
update and refine it.

I could try to make some of the assets, especially materials. We'll see.

### Concept
PVE or PVP tank game using terrain as strategic asset. Retro/Tron style

### Rules
 - Vehicles can move around the level, terrains with a slope too high cannot be traversed.
 - Vehicles start with a limited amount of health (HP)
 - Each direct hit or AoE deals damage to HP
 - Once a vehicle reaches 0 HP it is destroyed
 - The last team of vehicles (i.e. one of the players or the AIs) that remains wins

### Requirements
 - Assets: Low-poly tanks, with turrets detached from body; Projectiles; terrain
 - SFX: Shots, Explosions, Engine noise, Turret moving
 - Materials: Tron style materials, Particle effects
 - BGM: Retro electronic music
